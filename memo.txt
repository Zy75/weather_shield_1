< overview >

Sparkfun's weather shield is a arduino shield capable of measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, light_level and more. And by using optional "Weather Meters", measurement of rain, wind speed and wind direction are possble.

The system I setup consists of Arduino Uno equipped with the weather shield, the Weather Meters and beaglebone black as a server.

Arduino sends data to BeagleBone Black using serial interface and the data are stored in BBB's storage.  
 
When check if the system is working is needed, ssh into BBB using Wifi.

< why I don't use commercial weather station >

There are weather station makers such as Davis, Oregon scientific, La crosse...
But the biggest reason is I can't use these in Japan because of the radio law.

< Arduino Uno + weather shield >

Weather shield is a shield which means it is a board expanding arduino's functions.

weather_shield_example.ino is the open source firmware of arduino downloadable at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-shield-hookup-guide.
And I wrote this program to the flash memory with Arduino IDE.

USB-SERIAL converter is available on Arduino Uno and its USB port can be used, so BBB receives data as virtual serial interface.
 

< BeagleBone black (BBB) as a server >

I installed Debian linux on BBB.

BBB sees arduino as /dev/ttyACM0(virtual serial) and python script ws.py receives the data.
When I ssh from desktop PC to BBB, to keep the script running after ssh logout, I must use nohup command:
[ nohup sudo -b python ws.py > /dev/null 2> /dev/null < /dev/null ] ( stdin, stdout and stderr are not used. So discard these using /dev/null ) 

When I want to check the system, login wirelessly using [ sudo ssh username@192.168.xx.xx ]

Wifi adapter and Cable from Arduino must be used but there is only one USB port on BBB. And because of consuming current of Wifi adapter, self-powered USB-hub is needed.
Wifi adapter I bought is BUFFALO WLI-UC-G301n. The sensitivity is good. 

< wall box , wind meter and rain meter installation >

Arduino+WeatherMeters, BBB, USB-hub, and AC-adapters is in MIRAI-KOGYO wall box. 

I used BK-32ZR(product for BS CS antenna support) to install weather meters.

< memo of BBB debian software installation >

write ssid and password in /etc/network/interfaces

write rfkill unblock all , ifdown wlan1, ifup wlan1 in /etc/rc.local
This is needed because wirelessLAN is disabled by rfkill by default.
/etc/rc.local runs after systemd's multiusertarget

< wind direction memo >
Calculation of wind direction:
Japan Meteorological Agency uses unit vector average method, in which ,all samplings regardless of wind speed are treated equal. In this project, weather_shield_example.ino uses the same method, and is OK.

(my memo)
Wind direction:
S 180
W 270
E 90
N 0
(when speed meter west and direction meter east)


< other memo >
There are pullup resistors in some pin of wind sensor, and rain sensor.
